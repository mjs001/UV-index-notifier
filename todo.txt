-Need to work on get_uv_index
-Need to get UV forecast data, need to extract just the days (24) and just matching uv index (24)
    -need to create new dictionary or new list with each time and uv index
    -need to return this data
    -then in get_current_uv_index method need to loop through and find the corresponding uv index to the time from get_current_time_for_uv_index and return that, the human readable date, and time
    -then I need to go through and loop through all of the forecast data then need to look through and include time until you get to time above 1 and document the start uv index and stop, then once looped through all of them, convert it to human readable times
    -then need to return the date, time, current uv index, and all the times list


CURRENT:

I have the uv_index_forecast_request request first getting the time then it returns [["2025-07-20T11:00", 0.00] ...] this format for the times and uv indexes, it removes the times before the current time and all times after that arent the current date and then returns a list of lists with the time and the uv index.
    - still need to go through lists and group together times that are sequential and are under 1 or at 1 uv index and then make then new list have the appropriate human friendly blocks of time ex 10 am - 12 pm etc. and for one hour just 9 am - 10 am
